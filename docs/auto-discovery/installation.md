# Overview
The secureCodeBox (SCB) AutoDiscovery feature automates the process of setting up scheduled scans for Kubernetes entities inside a cluster. The AutoDiscovery will observe the scanned Kubernetes entities over their whole lifecycle. It will automatically create, update and delete scans when necessary. Currently the SCB AutoDiscovery supports two modes that can be enabled independently: A service and a container AutoDiscovery.
